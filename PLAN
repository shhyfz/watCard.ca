Issues:
1. Agree to the policies. Need to be selected to proceed to next step.
Once click on the "I agree" button, a policy will be displayed with a botton "I agree with the policy" following.

2. Activate keyboard "Enter" to apply the input field (Done)

3. When clicking on other buttons, the exsiting button will disappear. If the input is valid, apply it. 
If not, load the previous valid input or leave it empty. (Done)

-----------------
Known issues:

1. In generator View: delay was used to prevent input box from showing and disappering. (Not an issue anymore)
2. In generator View: limited input validation available. (Should be enough now)
3. In generator View: If user does not change selection, it does not update the view and model.(Start-up)
4. In watCard View: need to replace "STUDENT" with image. (Last step.)
5. Exp graduate year logic needs to re-write. (Do we still have this issue?)



Generator Page Plan:
Updated 8/22/2013 3:43

----------------

When clicking on any item, it will display a box with the same color as the one clicked on.
Use JS to call the display of box and the border shadow.
Once the inputed text is accepted, the font and color of original field will be changed.

For every specific field, specify here:

1. First name n last name:
	textarea (allow letter and "'" only)
	
2. Student id:
	has only 8 number field. can input number only and not exceed length of eight.
	
3. Faculty n status:
	on every block, their is another BLACK block with opicity. the pointer-hover one will be 5% opicity. 
	and all others will increase by 5%.
	Call this by JS
	once clicked on, the change will be maken.
	
	Once clicking on Others, a mailto: link is activated to ask the user to fill what is missing.
	And shows an Others at card.
	
4. Year:
	Samilar to faculty. but their are two more columns "up" and "down" which have no extra black block.

5. Agree:
	After cliking on I agree, it will check all the fields. If all fields are okay, "WatCardIt" will be activated
	(I agree might change to "I am Ready")
	
6. WatCardIt 
	This will be changed to "WatCard Me" @ version 0.2
	Change to another color (both a and div) and font (a). and build the bridge to the final picture.
